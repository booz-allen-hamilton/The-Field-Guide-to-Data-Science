Going Deep into Machine Learning
================================

**Machines are getting better at learning by mimicking the human brain.**

Think about where you were 10 years ago. Could computers understand and take action based upon your spoken word? Recently, speech-to-text quality has improved dramatically to nearly perfect accuracy, much to the delight of many mobile phone users. In other complex tasks, similar magic capabilities have emerged. The world-record high scores in 29 video games are now held by a machine learning algorithm with no specific knowledge of Atari or computer games in general. 

These impressive feats were made possible by deep learning, a different way of approaching machine learning problems. Most approaches to machine learning require humans to encode logic and rules to create features, which are then fed into machine learning models. In some domains, such as audio, text, image, and signal processing, effective feature engineering requires considerable human expertise to achieve decent model performance. Deep learning avoids the necessity of human-encoded features and instead incorporates the feature engineering, feature selection, and model fitting into one step. 

Deep learning is an extension of an idea originating in the 1950s called neural networks, which are loosely inspired by our understanding of how neurons in our brains operate. Recent hardware developments, originally designed for faster renderings of graphics, birthed a renaissance in neural networks. The latest graphical processing units, or GPUs, have more than 3,000 processing cores that are well suited for parallel processing of complex matrix manipulations required for rendering graphics – and for executing computations on neural networks. 

In the late 2000s, the combination of GPUs, advances in algorithms, and collections of big data reignited interest in neural networks. GPUs enabled computers to process much larger networks in much less time, and clever advances in algorithms made the model fitting process more efficient. Large collections of image, video, and text data provided content for the deep learning algorithms to learn. The ability to train larger networks with more data drove the exploration of new neural network architectures featuring additional hidden layers and widening the breadth of the networks. 

Presently, deep learning has moved beyond academic applications and is finding its way into our daily lives. Deep learning powers speech-to-text on our mobile phones and smart devices, image search provided by major tech companies, language translation services for text and spoken word, and even drug discovery within advanced pharmaceutical companies.
